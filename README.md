# Cisco Community Solutions Repository



Repository and workspace for examples inspired by trolling in Cisco Communities.

This repository is, by definition, a work in progress.

Note that there are a number of virtual environment requirements files.   If a script does not call out a specific requirements document in the Doc String, start with the requirements-default.txt file.
